📐 Interactive 2D Floor and Layout Creator (Mobile-First)

  🌟 Introduction
  
    The 2D Floor and Layout Creator is a simple web tool designed for visualizing and planning interior designs, with a particular focus on simulating laminate or wood flooring installation patterns.
    
    Its main purpose is to allow users to define room dimensions, choose the plank pattern (straight lay or herringbone), and place furniture to preview the final design. The application is optimized for touch interaction      on mobile devices.
  
  🔑 Key Features
  
    Mobile-First Design: Fully responsive interface that adapts and works perfectly on phones and tablets.
    
    Touch and Mouse Interaction: Allows furniture to be dragged and relocated directly onto the floor plan using touch gestures or a mouse.
    
    Flooring Simulation: Supports the visualization of plank patterns (straight lay with adjustable stagger, and herringbone simulation).
    
    Furniture Management:
    
    Predefined furniture catalog (living room, bedroom, kitchen).
    
    Ability to add furniture with custom dimensions.
    
    Rotation (45° increments) and deletion functionality for selected items.
    
    Cutting Analysis: Simulation tool that highlights floor areas requiring cuts and adaptations around the furniture, helping to estimate material and installation complexity.
  
  🛠️ Technologies Used
  
    This project is a single-page application and is built using fundamental web technologies:
    
    HTML5: Application structure.
    
    CSS3 (Pure): Basic styles and media queries to ensure complete adaptability (mobile-first).
    
    Vanilla JavaScript: All application logic, Canvas event handling, touch interaction, drag logic, and 2D floor plan drawing.
    
    Canvas API: Used for the efficient and dynamic rendering of the room layout and furniture.
  
  🚀 Getting Started
  
    Since this is a Single-File Application, getting started is immediate.
    
    Open the File: Simply open the Suelo.html file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    
    Configure Dimensions: In the "Room Dimensions" section, adjust the Width (W) and Height (H) in meters.
    
    Add Furniture:
    
    Use the Furniture Catalog to quickly add items.
    
    Use the Custom Furniture inputs to define an item with specific measurements.
    
    Interact (Mobile):
    
    Tap a piece of furniture on the plan to select it.
    
    Press and drag the selected piece of furniture to change its position.
    
    Use the control buttons (Rotate/Delete) to manipulate the active item.
    
    Simulate Flooring: Adjust the plank width, length, and pattern in the corresponding section.
